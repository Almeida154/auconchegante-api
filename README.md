### Architecture

This project have Java and Node services. Java is used for the main services, like Authentication, Booking
and Payment. While Node is used for secondary services, such as Notification. All services are built
with Clean Architecture or Hexagonal Architecture.

PS.: I am using a monorepo only because it is a personal project to practice back-end skill. Soon a
client-side will consume this API, probably a Flutter app.

- Ports and Adapters Architecture / Clean Architecture
- Domain-Driven Design
- REST APIs
- WebSocket
